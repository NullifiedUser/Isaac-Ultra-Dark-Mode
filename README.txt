>>YOU STILL NEED THE ORIGINAL MODS<<

To make this as easy as possible all you do is open the mod you want to Patch/Fix and drag and drop the folder resources to 
Issac Ultra Dark Mode if promted with replace do so this will replace my graphics with the desired mod and should resolve any issues

Example in a step by step

Step 1. Go to C:\Steam\steamapps\common\The Binding of Isaac Rebirth\mods\! isaac ultra dark mode
OR you can right click Binding of issac in steam > Browse Local Files mods > ! isaac ultra dark mode [rep+]

Step 2. Patches & Fixes
Step 3. Yet Another Portraits
Step 4. Copy the resources file
Step 5. Go back to my main folder the one with the metadata.xml
Step 6. Paste the resources
Step 7. If promted to replace do so.
